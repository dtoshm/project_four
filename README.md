Project Overview

Use your knowledge of CSV and File I/O and database ORMs to build a console application that allows you to easily interact with data for a store's inventory. The data needs to be cleaned from the CSV before it is added to the database. All interactions with the records should use ORM methods for viewing records, creating records, and exporting a new CSV backup.

Environment requirements found in requirements.txt.

All code was written by me using the techdegree videos as my primary source. 
I used Google/forums for learning how to skip the header row when adding data from a csv to a database. 
I asked ChatGPT to learn how to export a database into a backup csv and implemented my own custom version.
I used ChatGPT to refine my function comments, will continue to practice this until i'm as good to save time.
